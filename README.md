Authored by **Peter Machonan** for **HeySalad** on 10th Nov 2024

Welcome to the **Nutritionists Copilot Dashboard**! This project is an open-source dashboard tailored specifically for nutritionists. It leverages advanced AI technology, including **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs)**, to support nutrition professionals in delivering personalized dietary recommendations, managing client information, and generating insights. 

We welcome contributions from developers, nutritionists, and anyone interested in improving this tool.
